# My-Solutions-to-machine-learning-assignments-coursera

This repo is specially created for all the work I have done while taking Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, I did the assignments using MATLAB. The codes for those assignments are pushed in this repo. Most of the code is pre-written, my code goes in the space below "YOUR CODE HERE".

# Course outline
